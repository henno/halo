Halo PHP Framework
===

Halo is an extremly simple, open source, mixed MVC-like base for your projects, built using PHP5, by me, Henno Täht, with some help from my students. 
It aims to be easy to undestand, effortless to use and using a small footprint.

Released under a BSD license, Halo can be used legally for any open source, commercial, or personal project.

Documentation
------

There is no documentation other than the source code itself. Just start reading from index.php and look at the example files. You will understand the *whole* project in less than an hour, which is the main goal of the project.


Installation
------

git clone Go make your new git project, get the zip, unpack it and try to run it. You'll get some errors. Just do what it suggests. Basically you should copy config.sample.php to config.php and configure it. After that you should set up your MySQL database (sorry, no other databases support ATM).

Reporting bugs
------

If you've stumbled across a bug, please help us out by reporting the bug you have found using Github's Issue tracker. If you'd like to fix it yourself, feel free to fork the project on GitHub and submit a pull request!
